A vegetarian Indian recipe website
Absolutely! Here is a detailed, structured, and visually appealing README file for your Vegetarian Indian Recipe website, ready for GitHub.

🌶️ Pure Veg Delights: Indian Recipe Hub
Overview
Welcome to Pure Veg Delights! This is a simple, modern, and user-friendly website dedicated to authentic and delicious vegetarian Indian cuisine. Built primarily with HTML, CSS, and dynamic interactions powered by JavaScript, this site aims to be your go-to resource for cooking everything from quick weeknight dals to elaborate festive sweets.

The focus is on making traditional Indian recipes accessible to home cooks of all skill levels.

✨ Features
This project showcases several key front-end features powered by JavaScript:

🔍 Interactive Recipe Search: Instantly filter recipes by name, ingredient, or regional cuisine using live search functionality (client-side JS filtering).

Categories & Tags: Browse recipes easily by course (e.g., Main, Snack, Dessert), spice level, or special diets (e.g., Vegan, Gluten-Free).

⭐ Dynamic Recipe Cards: JavaScript dynamically loads and displays recipe cards, including images, a brief description, and a quick-view tag.

⏲️ Serving/Quantity Adjuster: A feature (to be implemented/demonstrated) allowing users to adjust the serving size, which in turn recalculates ingredient quantities using JS logic.

Responsive Design: Optimized layout for viewing on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Lightweight & Fast: Focus on efficient code for quick loading times.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: The semantic structure of the website.

CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid): Modern styling and responsive layout management.

JavaScript (ES6+): All dynamic functionality, including DOM manipulation, search, filtering, and data handling.

Local Recipe Data: Recipe information is stored in a local JSON file or JavaScript array for client-side access.
